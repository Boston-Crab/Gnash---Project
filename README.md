- Led a team consisting of a Pixel Artist, a Musician, and a Contributing Tester, successfully working together full-time on a daily basis for two months to create a product.

- My responsibilities also included GDScript programming, game design, level design, SFX design, and management.

- The project had a self imposed hard deadline which was successfully reached by all team members.
